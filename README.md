# Kinetic model for two-dimensional planar defects
A layer model for kinetics of segregations at two-dimensional planar defects. 


The models are presented in the [model folder](https://github.com/Dongsheng-Wen/Segregation_kinetics/tree/643e6b133fdaeb780ce7c0594a7c1f9b617c9e51/models). 

The jupyter notebooks to reproduce the segregation profiles are provided in the [notebooks folder](https://github.com/Dongsheng-Wen/Segregation_kinetics/tree/643e6b133fdaeb780ce7c0594a7c1f9b617c9e51/notebooks).
